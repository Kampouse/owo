
Working on projects that have extraordinary impacts is a core ethos of Owo. 

However, the aim of this application isn't purely technological; it's fundamentally human. We seek to change humans to enhance communication among people. 

To enact planetary-scale changes, whether it's to save the ecology, combat extreme capitalism, or fight injustices worldwide, people must be ready to change. And for that to happen, they need to feel capable of making a difference. 

To empower an individual to effect such change, their basic needs must be met. One of the long-neglected human needs, which continues to be overlooked, is the need for support, the need to connect with others, and the need for love. Despite being social animals, we often forget that our social networks extend beyond our nuclear families. We're strangers to our neighbors, unfamiliar with those we live amongst, lacking trust in those with whom we coexist. We've built barriers that only allow direct paths to the few individuals we know, isolating us further. 

This isolation keeps humans calm and controllable. Yet, humans don't have control over Earth's direction or the trajectory of humanity itself. Many believe we're headed for disaster, yet few think they can make an impact.

To ensure humans feel well, healthy, and safe enough to initiate change, we must address their basic needs. Owo is an attempt to meet the fundamental need for human sociability. 

It's a technological tool designed to break down the barriers that separate people from their neighbors and communities. It aims to foster connections, encourage meetings, and develop supportive relationships where trust can flourish. Owo creates a platform free of discrimination, where everyone can support each other and acknowledge their shared humanity.

Thus, contributing to this project is to contribute to a hope of nourishing humans so they're capable of improving the situation we find ourselves in.

In line with Owo's mission, the platform is developed with features that distinguish it from competitors like Facebook Marketplace and Kijiji by focusing on lending, renting, and sharing over buying and selling and on an ultra-local scale.
